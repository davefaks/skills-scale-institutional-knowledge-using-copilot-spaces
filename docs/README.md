# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview
This folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes for rapid onboarding and consistent delivery. It provides a short summary of the way we plan, execute, release, and learn from our projects, plus direct links to each process document for deeper guidance.

OctoAcme organizes work around a clear lifecycle: Initiation (validate and authorize work), Planning (turn initiatives into a prioritized backlog and release plan), Execution (build, test, review, iterate), Release (deploy and verify), and Retrospective (capture learnings and improve). We emphasize customer-first outcomes, iterative delivery of shippable increments, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions.

Operational workflows use a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), a pull request workflow with CI and small PR guidance, and a lightweight set of artifacts (Project One‑pager, Roadmap, Backlog, Risk Register, and Retrospectives). Roles are explicit — Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA — and communication follows a predictable cadence: daily standups, regular PM/PdM syncs, weekly delivery updates, demos at milestones, and monthly stakeholder reports.

Quality assurance blends automated testing (unit, integration, E2E smoke), CI security scans, and manual QA where needed. Releases require acceptance criteria met, passing CI, release notes and a rollback plan, with a documented incident/rollback playbook. Risks and dependencies are tracked in the risk register and escalated through team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor as needed.
